        <h3 class="salute"><u>APPLICAION FOR THE POST OF <span id="lbuser">CONTRUCTION MANAGER</span></u></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="main">
      <p>With respect to you advertisement on a National newspaper for the vancancy
          on the position of a <span id="t3">Contruction Manager</span> dated 1st March, 2020, I humbly apply
          for the position.
      </p>
      <p>I am a graduate of <span id="t2" contentEditable>Yaba Colleged of Technology</span> on <span id="t1">November 25th, 2020</span> With
          a distintion; and a well trained experience during industrial training program
          for both the four months of break and one year of indutrial training (IT).
      </p>
      <p>I attended my Primary school at <span id="t6">holiness Nursery and Primary school,</span> <span id="t7">Otukpo Benue</span> State, where i got my First School Leaving Certificate. I furthered to government Day Secondary School, Otukpo, Benue State and acquired my NECO and WAECE with a good grade dated fro year 2003 to 2008. I later further my educcation at <span id="t5">Yaba College of Education</span> where i graduated with distinction in Computer Scince and also the best graduating students of Computer Science dated from 2009 to 2013 including the one year and four month industrial tarining program.</p>
      <p>During my four month training program i was lucky and God so kind applied for the rest of IT in Julius Berger Contruction company wherfe i was accepted within the period, and i learnt a lot of such as the terms and conditions in construction company. Here i was taught on how to use most of the machine for construction and also was giving fatherly training from my Boss whom i was serving under him. When the perved of my IT elapse i was giving an approval letter from the management of Julius Berger to come anytime am through with my Ordinary Diploma(ND) program and continue with them.</p>
      <p>At my one year industrail training period i also joined them with respect to approval given to me from my four months period. Here i gained a lot in construction and management because my Boss was later transfer to Portharcour and i was only one handed over the management process to, also i was the only one who was taught on how the company operate due to relationship between both of us.</p>
      <p>With the above reasons stated, i am sure that your company will never regrate having me as their manager and also giving some of your staff preferencial training on the operation of so manay machines which i got the knowledge already.</p>
      <p>Thanks for your co-operation</p>
      <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
